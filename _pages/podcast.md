I recently sat and meditated and played the flute in a church courtyard in Chiapas. The local children came around to listen. A boy asked what my flute was made of. He didnâ€™t know the Spanish name for bamboo and asked his brother what the plant was called in Maya. We were stuck on this until I saw he was leaning against a bamboo tree that was the perfect size and species for making flutes. There were hundreds of seeds lying underneath. I had been thinking for several weeks that I need to buy some seeds from somewhere so I can grow my own materials to begin to make bamboo flutes.
Last year I visited a cooperative university for indigenous students. I had my flute with me and the fellows in the wood shop said they wanted to replicate it. Meanwhile, they were playing a Brandenburg Concerto in the background. I would like to work with them on that project. Since then I have drilled out new holes to make it a 12-toned instrument that can play all tonalities. These selections are some of my favorite pieces that I enjoy playing on this instrument.
