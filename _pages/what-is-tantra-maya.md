Maya Meditation, or Tantra Maya is a synthesis between the ancient spiritual practices of the Maya and the classical tantric meditation system of India.  Tantra is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, "ta", which means dullness, and "tra", which signifies expansion.  Tantra is therefore "expansion from dullness."  It is the rational and ethical spiritual practice of using yoga and meditation to expand one's spiritual potential.

My wife was a student of Quetzal Manik, a Mayan healer and yogi from Campeche.  She interprets "maya" as the spiritual practices of the Mayan people.  These practices have been transmitted through mayan lineages for centuries.  While writing about Tantra Maya, I interpret "maya" according to the Sanskrit definition: the divine mystery of how the infinite being hides itself in the finite realm through each and every being only to eventually desire a return to a state of essential oneness with the infinite consciousness.  Tantra Maya is therefore the advanced and experimental study of Tantra as a universal intuitive science as well as a system of Mayan meditation.  The Tantra Maya healing and meditation practices are remarkably similar to the oriental practices of Tantra Yoga.  Like Tantra Yoga of India, Tantra Maya was developed in the jungle by Mayan mystics and healers who lived close to nature.  Many of the exercises and meditation postures are named after animals.  Both systems are practical sciences in that the practitioner follow certain disciplines and  meditate to understand and verify the theoretical knowledge offered by these systems.

Perhaps with further investigation one may find a link between them and some schools of Shaeva Tantra (Tantra inspired by Shiva).  I also share the writings of Anandamurti on this site.  Anandamurti systematized the ancient practices of the Tantric Yogis of India with very lucid, modern interpretations.  His philosophy has been preserved in over 200 works that Anandamurti himself dictated.  Tantra Maya uses the Mayan spiritual meditative practices of Quetzal Manik along with the tantra philosophy of Anandamurti as a rational guide and inspiration for these subtle, introspective practices.
