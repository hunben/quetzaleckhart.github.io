### Black Crows

Pluma Blanca arrived at the ranch the other day.  He came just at the right time as I was completely exhausted with the defense of our ranch against the Santa Muerte neighbors.  Whenever these demons kidnap and torture people they turn on a motorcycle without a muffler that is very noisy and covers the screams of the tortured.  I had hardly slept for a week because they turned on that motorcycle every night between midnight and 3 a.m., the traditional "witching hour" when dark occultist have traditionally performed their rights.  Instead of sleeping, I meditated all through these dark hours.

The Santa Muerte is the death cult of some narco groups. They really do practice death rituals. We practice life rituals. They call in their demonic helpers and we call in our friends, both embodied and disembodied. Our “dance of the blessed spirits” is to help us create a spiritual vortex of resistance against all forms of degeneration in order to preserve our species, a united human clan existing within the Supreme Consciousneness.

The ranch was recently invaded by a flock of crows.  They come and attack the other birds.  We had almost no birds here in the desert until we dug our trenches to collect rainwater and make a mini oasis.  To me, it seemed a perfect literary image: all of this suffering and death adorned with a final, dreadful touch of black crows that prey on our peaceful dove and sparrow.  It was as if reality is communicating with me through symbols.  Its uncanny, but is it just my imagination?

Pluma Blanca began beating his drum and shouting in Maya and then chanting "Baba Nam Kevalam."  I ran outside from my meditations and was inspired to go and attack the narco compound with my bare hands, such was the inspiration.  He was chasing off the crows.  I understood that he saw them as an ominous symbol.  He pointed to the crows and then to the direction of the narco compound.  I intuitively understood that he saw the crows as a live symbol connected with the narco camp.  If we run them off, then we effect those whom they serve.  It all made a certain symbolic sense, and I went along with it all in a high state of emotion and put my intellectual questions aside for the moment.  At that time we begin to hear the motorcycle.  It gets closer and we see a man riding it and shouting like a madman.  It was the first time we had seen the motorcycle and the rider leave the compound.  We had a chance to look him in the eyes and send him a gaze that penetrated his entire being.  He won't come around any longer.

I have lived with indigenous Mexican indians for the last 13 years.  Although I sometimes doubt their credulity in such magic realities, I have seen so many occasions in which these ideas have lead to the most amazing revelations of truth.  Pluma Blanca was a very refined yogi. My wife was his favorite student. He understood all of these practices without superstition and myth and taught very advanced, systematic meditations to understand these "magical realities."

### A Parapsychologist, Please

The other day a woman who helps us here in our gardens was returning home to the local village. On the way home she was approaching a lake which is just about 1/2 km from here. She heard a muffled gunshot, as if fired from close range. She thought somebody must be sacrificing a cow or goat that was injured or ill by the lake. A moment later she sees a figure of a man in a plaid shirt running away from the lake and into the bare desert. He promptly disappears and it made her doubt if there really was a figure. However, she was certain there was and knew it wasn’t her imagination. She checked to see if he left any tracks in the sand but she didn’t see any.

As she got even closer to the lake she saw that there were police vehicles there. She saw them removing the body of a man with the same plaid shirt as the figure who was running away from the lake. Unfortunately, our once quiet little valley has turned into Buchenvald and this happens all of the time. We have an embarrassing gas problem around here, you know, the Haliburton kind. Do the narcos work for them? Hopefully the world is tuned into this; we are sitting ducks. Too bad there are all of these poor people around here that need to go away before the gas wells are drilled. I wonder how those that plan these schemes justify it to their warped conscience? What kind of story do they tell to themselves or their families?

In the meanwhile I ponder what it is she saw. Was it a premonition like a pre-cognitive event that occurs before something that really overwhelms the mind? For example, many mothers will have this type of pre-cognition at the same time their children suffer an accident far away. Or was it the perception of the murdered man’s spirit escaping the scene of a terrible death. Or has Quetzal Bill been into the peyote patch? That is a joke of course. Anybody who knows me knows that I take these weird phenomenon very seriously and I always try to see it from all angles. I lean more toward my first idea of a pre-cognitive event but I am open to suggestions.
