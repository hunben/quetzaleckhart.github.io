The main function of the ego and intellect at the Svadhistana Vortex (2nd chakra) is to secure the emerging sense of identity from the womb of unconsciousness and blind instinct, which characterize the pre-conscious and pre-human mind at the Muladhara, Sensory Mind (1st chakra). Once a secure base for the personality is established in a balanced Svadhistana Vortex, the personality can begin to expand and encounter new qualities and experiences. Here we see the continued expansion of the ego and the effort to expand the Conceptual Mind so as to acquire a greater degree of meaningful psychological development. The higher expressions of the personality are unable to express themselves completely in the Svadhistana due to the primary activity of maintaining and securing the psychological grounding of the identity. Once there is a stable emotional foundation the personality can flourish and expand.

The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word artha is relief or alleviation. It refers to the relief one gets after the struggle to find the name of an object whose name is unknown. This unknowing creates a tension in the mind that impels the mind to seek equilibrium by finding the meaning of something in order to give classification to that which is not understood. When the meaning or definition is found there is a sense of relief as the mental equilibrium is restored. In other words, artha is the willful endeavor of the intellect to acquire form and meaning for both the self and its world, an activity not quite possible for the second vortex due to its occupation with primary self-establishment of the personality. The fundamental need at the Manipura Vortex (3rd chakra) is the need for novel, creative self-definition. This need is directed toward social and creative activities instead of being occupied with basic emotional and existential security.

The path toward self-definition begins to qualify the growth and development of artha. The Aham (ego, personal) intelligence of the personality is confronted with new challenges that force the mind to seek creative and resourceful ways to face these challenges. Development is not though contracted, defensive emotional instincts as with the Svadhistana. The Manipura mind desires qualities and has conceptual capacities beyond the mundane Conceptual Mind and self. In the 2nd vortex there is a drive toward basic, psychological self-preservation, while with the Manipura there is a vigorous outward, drive toward self-definition and expansion. The second vortex utilizes the Conceptual Mind, while the Manipura refines this basic conceptual power with the qualities of creativity and innovation. The Aham, or personality grows by internalizing and digesting more and more of its desires for the objective, external world. It is at this stage that the Aham begins to have more control over the sensory mind as it attempts to manipulate and maneuver the external world with its creative intellect. In this process the personality acquires more clarity of experience and with this knowledge is capable of even further expansion.

Here it is important to mention the relationship between the vrttis (mental desires) embedded in their respective vortexes and the layers of mind associated with their respective vortexes. The expressions of the vrttis correspond perfectly with the functions of the mind of that level. The cognitive aspects of the vortexes can’t stand apart from the emotive ones. A mind trying to establish itself in the world of the Conceptual Mind needs stout emotive tendencies to hold it’s ground. And it is quite necessary for a mind that reaches the dynamic creative layer to have powerful attractions and drives toward that realm. This relationship between the propensities and the mental layers, or between emotive and cognitive factors, is a constant relation on all mental levels.

The creative mental layer, or Atimanasa Kosa, is the level of mind that perceives the emanation of form from the “luminous factor.” The luminous factor is an invisible form field, or “morphogenic field,” that imposes a certain order and form on the material world. Form is something mental and spiritual that manifests physically. All things that exist have a subtle form field upholding their physical being. Just as there is a unified field of “liquid” energy behind matter, there is a “luminous” form field behind both the liquid and solid factors. At the creative mental level the Aham itself is a form, with a ideal form of a person embedded deep within. The forms in the mind are archetypes of creativity for the Aham that are guided by the Macrocosmic Mind. Recall that Macrocosmic Mind has always guided the evolution of the microcosmic mind. It has guided the evolution of physical instincts in the first vortex and the primal thought forms of the Conceptual Mind at the second vortex. The creative intellect begins to perceive these archetypal, creative impulses and find ways to express them in its person. These forms resonate with the mind and guide it in a particular cognitive and emotive direction. At this stage of mental evolution, Aham is struggling to arise out of the mundane Conceptual Mind and trying to enlighten itself with a creative and conceptual understanding of form. “Without vision a people perish,” states the Bible. The Manipura needs a deep vision and outlook to be fully functioning, otherwise it is like a sick organ. Only broad, universal ideas keep the Creative Mind out of trouble. Any ideology or vision of life that isn’t based on universal principles that promote universal love will block the vigorous expansion of the Manipura. By nature, desire for expansion will always be egocentric, but it is possible for the ego to be aware of this and try to convert selfishness into selflessness. Such is the path to human happiness. Slowly, the binding, impulsive remnants of animal life begin to be transmuted into conscious awareness. The creative layer of the mind guides us to the illumination of things once dark and obscure.
When these fundamental needs of the Creative Mind are not fulfilled, then the emotive vrttis attempt to force and impose meaning and form for the struggling, unfulfilled ego. The luminous, fiery element of the Manipura gives this vortex its fiery, impassioned ability to psychologically enlighten inner, conceptual forms. The Manipura has tremendous power and creativity but also tremendous capacity for conflict and even destruction when the person hasn’t found their own vision and instead seeks substitute gratification in mundane forms. Manipura literally translates to the ‘city of jewels’.

The creative Manipura mind is a whole new faculty for the evolving, Conceptual Mind. Gradually, the basic concepts of the Svadhistana acquire more elaborate color and form at the Manipura. A strong, developed Manipura has learned and accomplished many things and therefore has a little practical knowledge of existence and more self-confidence and definition. A less developed Manipura will be frustrated, ambitious, fearful and feel compelled to follow the superficial forms of social convention instead of one’s own creative, innovative desires. The consumptive and ambitious tendencies of the weak Manipura Vortex are concerned more with the attempt to acquire externally rather than to actually realize the true meaning of self. This emerging personality in the Manipura blindly fixates on selfish attachments and ambitions. Therefore, the outward and vigorous development of the Manipura is not just expanding toward something greater, but is compensating for the psychological inferiority and limitations of the Svadhistana. Here we see how the active and passionate qualities of the Manipura Vortex compensate for the entropy, dullness and lethargy of the Svadhistana. Due to the nature of these drives the mind is driven more toward external form rather that inner, spiritual symbols. It may grasp an intimation of infinity with the understanding of subtle ideas but still projects its infinite desires into the material world. The propensities that distort the Manipura, Creative Mind must be purified by the cognitive abilities of the Creative Mind for the Aham to develop. A balanced Manipura Vortex gives one a vital and very refined Creative Mind that can perceive itself much deeper and resolve in a creative manner its limitations and challenges. Such a person has a healthy passion for life, is active in pursuing his/her desires, is in constant need for new and meaningful experiences, and is incessantly working at self-improvement and transformation. Such a well-balanced person will naturally resonate with positive, expansive thought forms and will have an authentic, sincere vision of life. The Manipura mind shines with brilliant gems. If we go after a few particular gems, we lose site of the whole. To conceptually comprehend the great purpose of one’s existence and have the confidence and heart to follow it is the greatest gift of the Manipura, Creative Mind. This is not the realization of the Self as Shiva, but rather the realization of the Aham’s particular purpose as a human being in a human world. It is a stage in the journey as only a sturdy, confident ego can let go of its limitations and begin to peer into the Infinite window within.
