The other morning I started playing requiem music again for the bad guys in the area. They never live long and every time they start to get too curious about why we haven't abandoned our home to them, something always happens and they never return. New death soldiers come to inhabit the old places and then they die and this cycle has happened time and time again. I was in meditation retreat even before they arrived I became one with the spirit of the desert. I feel these new arrivals as if they entered inside my own mind and I have struggled to comprehend what it is they do and why they do it. They know their time is short and so they worship the Santa Muerte. However, there is still a small part of them that is still human and suffers. 

After seeing that narco demon on the motorcycle that I mentioned  on the previous post, <a href="http://tantramaya.org/the-gaze-of-the-assassin-and-the-mind-of-buddha/">http://tantramaya.org/the-gaze-of-the-assassin-and-the-mind-of-buddha/<a/>, I finally realized what Anandamurti meant when he said that there are humans that are even less conscious and sensible than animals and are really no longer even human in their minds. Rather, they are like demons. However, I still see a spark of consciousness behind all of this. It doesn’t manifest, but because it is still conscious it has what seems like infinite shame and self hatred (two fundamental self-conscious tendencies) and a desire to escape this mental hell. Killers are the most unhappy people imaginable.  It is no wonder that after I saw the eyes of that assassin that I felt that he had intense desires to commit suicide. I don’t want to get near that dark energy, but it seems so clear as to why such dark mental parasites exist. Maybe it is just like a physical parasite, but in the mental realm. It has its place in nature to maintain balance, but sometimes it gets out of control. These energies can never touch one whose mind surrenders to the Supreme Consciousness; they only attack minds that are too engrossed in violence.  Low self esteem is a form of self-hatred, albeit in a much milder sense than in the narco assassin. Many good people who lose their confidence and faith in life have opted for this way out of their problems as well, but suicide it was always a victory for the illusionary ego. One came to believe that there was nothing else than one's little, miserable self.  One should never attach judgement to these ideas about suicides because sometimes people have the most profound sufferings that would be inimaginable for many to conceive.  The only way out is through deep insight into suffering, like my Buddhhist friends sincerely tell me. This realization gives one compassion for all beings that suffer in this apparently crooked, rickety wheel of existence. This distorted ego concept of control over ones imaginary self is a defense against an underlying self-hatred for one’s own fear based, and self-centered mental creation that has gone awry and lost its purpose and guiding function, despairs, then later makes some poor judgement and one get crushed under the cruel wheel of mundane existence. Life requires great ideas, or else we are done for, as one is crushed under the cruel wheel of mundane existence.  Everything depends upon one’s ideation and outlook. Like Blake said:

“Love seeketh not itself to please   

Nor for itself hath any care  

But for another gives its ease    

And builds a heaven in hell’s despair.”

Meditation and kiirtan keep away these and other negative microvita that erroneous human minds are proliferating. Our greatest defense against them both physically and mentally is our devotion and that terrifies the narcos just as much as it does the negative microvita. We won’t let them control us with their terror, and thereby direct the destiny of our minds and spirits. Our lives have a higher purpose and our eternal well-being is stamped and sealed if we have just a little bit of devotion.  Without even trying, our spiritual energy sends their dark motives back upon them. Kiirtan is the greatest defense because it is an act of surrender to the I-Witness that brings positive spiritual force, positive microvita. Our war is one of will, faith, and reason against materialism, lies and destruction and as well as the thoughts and energies behind these delusions.
